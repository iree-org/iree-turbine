# API Docs

This directory uses Sphinx to build documentation that is hosted at
https://iree-turbine.readthedocs.io/.

## Building the API documentation locally

### Setup virtual environment with requirements

From this docs/ directory:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install sphinx website generator requirements and PyTorch dep.
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r ../pytorch-cpu-requirements.txt

# Install iree-turbine itself.
# Editable so you can make local changes and preview them easily.
python -m pip install -e ..
```

### Build docs

```shell
sphinx-build -b html . _build
```

### Serve locally locally with autoreload

```shell
# Default config - only watch for changes to this folder (.rst files).
sphinx-autobuild . _build

# Advanced config - also watch for changes to the entire project (.py files).
sphinx-autobuild . _build --watch ..
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 as instructed by the logs and make changes to
the files in this directory as needed to update the documentation.
