    """Represents a named set of ExportedPrograms.

    This facility works around a design flaw in Torch where they conflated
    ExportedPrograms as representing a single entry-point while also having
    each instance persist its own state_dict and constants. How many times,
    in how many frameworks, do we have to fight this design flaw? Apparently
    once more.

    This base class represents the set of programs, either loaded from storage
    or built live. The tricky part it is managing is to do all of this while
    aliasing state and captured constants. Having those be physically shared
    is an essential optimization.

    In order to manage saving/loading of the set of things, we manually splice
    the state_dict and constants dict such that while saving, we only persist
    the first encountered instance of any reference. Any subsequent instances
    are replaced with a SharedStateTensor, which on load can be re-associated.

    As this is primarily targeted at being able to decouple FX tracing from
    further manipulation (which for reasons unknown, is competing with the
    race of entropy to the heat death of the universe in terms of performance),
    we don't take a lot of pains to be optimized for distribution or storage of
    the resulting artifacts.

    In the future, this same technique could be employed to elide parameters
    that we know we are going to resolve symbolically later, keeping them from
    being loaded and consuming memory during model export and compilation.

    We have faith that in the fullness of time, the design flaws in Torch that
    require this kind of thing to exist will be resolved, and we then won't
    need this hack.
