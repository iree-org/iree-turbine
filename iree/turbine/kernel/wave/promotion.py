    When accessing shared memory, we need to be cognizant of bank conflicts
    that can have a significant impact on performance. One way to mitigate
    these conflicts is by applying padding to the shared memory allocation.
    This function applies padding of 64 bits to the shared memory allocation.
    While this approach accomplishes the goal of reducing bank conflicts, it
    is inefficient in terms of memory usage. A more sophisticated approach
    would involve swizzling of the shared memory access patterns.

    Decompose and reorders read_from_global -> write_to_shared -> read_from_shared sequence.
    In the previous naive way, the generated instruction ordering used to look like:
    ```
    read_from_global lhs
    write_to_shared lhs
    shared_barrier
    read_from_shared lhs
    read_from_global rhs
    write_to_shared rhs
    shared_barrier
    read_from_shared rhs

    For this simple example, we have 2 shared barriers.

    Currently, this pass keep track of the last_write_to_shared, S.T
    read_from_global -> write_to_shared -> read_from_shared sequence
    can be inserted after the `last_write_to_shared` and before the
    last read from shared. This ensures that we isolate all the
    read_from_shared to be located one after another. This allows
    us to only need 1 shared barrier as seen below:

    write_to_shared lhs
    read_from_global lhs
    write_to_shared lhs
